There are 4 Types of Errors that can occur in PHP: 
Warning Error, Nocite Error, Parse Error and Fatal Error.
            Warning Errors don't stop the execution of the program. It only warns you that there is a problem that can likely cause bigger problems.
            They often happen while including external files or wrong used parameters in functions.
            Notice Errors are similar to Warning Errors and also don't stop the execution of the program.
            They usually occur when a undefined variable is used.
            Parse Errors (Syntax Error) are caused by misused symbols in the syntax. It stops the execution of the program.
            They are caused by: Unclosed brakcets or quotes, Mising or extra semicolons or parentheses and Misspellings.
            Fatal Erros crashes you programm and are classified as critical erros. It is also seperated in three diffrent types of fatal errors.
            Startup fatal error, when the system can't run the code at installation,
            Compile time fatal error, when a programmer tries to use nonexistent data,
            Runtime fatal error, happens while program is running, causing the code to stop working completly.
